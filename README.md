# EasyShop Backend API ‚Äì E-Commerce Capstone Project

Welcome to the backend development portion of **EasyShop**, an e-commerce platform that enables users to browse and purchase products online. This project represents **Version 2** of the EasyShop application, with a focus on debugging existing features and implementing new backend functionality using **Spring Boot** and a **MySQL database**.

---

## üìå Project Overview

EasyShop is an e-commerce web application that allows customers to browse products, manage their shopping cart, and complete purchases. This repository contains the backend API (Version 2) built with Spring Boot, which serves data to the frontend web application.

Role: Backend Developer
Version: 2.0 (Enhancement of existing Version 1)
Architecture: REST API with MySQL database integration

---

## ‚úÖ Core E-Commerce Functionality

- User registration and login
- Product browsing by category
- Search and filter functionality (with known bugs)
- Functional front-end website for interacting with the API
- Product catalog management
- Category-based product organization
- Shopping cart functionality
- User authentication and authorization
- Order processing and management
- User profile management

---

### üîß Fixing Existing Bugs

- **Bug #1**: Fixed search/filter endpoint returning incorrect results. Corrected the filtering mechanism.
- **Bug #2**: Debugged editing an existing product (e.g., changing price or description) resulting in duplicate entries instead of updating the current record. Ensured updates replace the correct record.

---

### üöÄ New Feature: Shopping Cart

Implemented a persistent shopping cart feature:

- Available only to **logged-in users**
- Items added to the cart are saved in the database and associated with the user
- Cart contents persist between sessions (e.g., logout ‚Üí login)
- Utilize the existing `shopping_cart` table in the database

---

### üß© Categories Management (ADMIN Only)

- Implementing all methods in `CategoriesController`
- Restricting category **insert**, **update**, and **delete** operations to users with the `ADMIN` role
- Completing missing logic in `MySqlCategoriesDao`

---

## üîç Testing & Debugging

You are expected to:

- Use **Postman** extensively to test each API endpoint
- Create and run **unit tests** for critical business logic
- Manually test edge cases and potential failure points

## üí° Future Improvements

Real-Time Chat Support:
Should allow customers to get instant support while browsing, with agents able to see customer's cart and order history. Also to assist with technical issues

Third-Party Shipping Integration:
Connect with UPS, FedEx, USPS APIs to get real-time shipping rates and tracking. Automatically calculate shipping costs based on package weight/dimensions and generate shipping labels when orders are placed.

Mobile App Development:
Creating REST endpoints optimized for mobile apps with reduced data payloads. Examples: bulk cart operations, condensed product summaries, single dashboard endpoints that combine multiple data sources.
